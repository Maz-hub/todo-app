## ToDo App

This is a simple **ToDo list app** that I built while learning **JavaScript, HTML, and CSS**. The app lets you:

-   ✅ **Add new tasks**
-   ✅ **Mark tasks as completed**
-   ✅ **Delete tasks**
-   ✅ **Keep tasks saved** even when you refresh the page (thanks to Local Storage)

### ✨ Features

-   **Mark tasks as completed** with a custom checkbox

-   Tasks are **saved in Local Storage**, so they remain after refreshing the page
